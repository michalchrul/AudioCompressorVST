This VST plugin was made with WDL-OL/iPlug and dsp++ libraries.

WDL-OL/iPlug
IPlug is a simple-to-use C++ framework for developing cross platform audio plugins and targeting multiple plugin APIs with the same code. Originally developed by Schwa/Cockos, IPlug has been enhanced by various contributors. IPlug depends on WDL, and that is why this project is called WDL-OL, although most of the differences from Cockos' WDL are to do with IPlug. This version of IPlug targets VST2, VST3, AudioUnit RTAS and AAX (Native) APIs. It can also produce standalone Windows/macOS audio/midi apps.
